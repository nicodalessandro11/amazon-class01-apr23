    <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
    <p>
      As we learned previously, semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we
      write. Before Semantic HTML the elements didnâ€™t have any meaning as to
      what it does or what content goes in it. An element such as div was used
      as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to
      articles.
      <br />
      With Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and
      browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it.
